/**
 * One row of the sidebar. There is only one.
 *
 * A group header, a node context, a page and the Recents row are the same
 * object at different depths: the same height, the same padding, the same
 * arrow slot, the same mark slot, the same number on the right. Anything a
 * caller wants to change is a prop, never a second set of numbers — two row
 * shapes is what made the panel read as several components stacked up.
 *
 * State is carried by COLOUR, not by weight. A row that goes bold when it is
 * selected re-flows its own text and shifts everything beside it, so the ramp
 * is: quiet when idle, brighter under the pointer, and settled in between when
 * it is the row you are on. Only a group header is bold, and it is bold in
 * every state.

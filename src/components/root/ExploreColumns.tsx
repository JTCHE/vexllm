/**
 * What a cold window opens onto instead of an empty Recents list.
 *
 * Three columns from the design. Nodes and Languages point at real branches
 * of the mirrored docs, the same way the sidebar tree does: a context's own
 * overview page sits at `<section>/<context>/index`, the way
 * `lib/landing/tree.ts` already assumes when it drops a hit ending in
 * `/index` from a branch's row list.
 *
 * Start here is the design's five rows, cut to the two the app can honestly
 * answer:
 *   - "Adding custom HDA docs" opens the mirrored SideFX page on writing an
 *     asset's own help (`help/nodes` — SideFX titles it "Documenting your
 *     assets").
 *   - "Set up the MCP" opens the Houdini MCP repo the README already points
 *     readers at. An external link is still an honest destination, the same
 *     way the reading view's own "SideFX" link opens the source in the
 *     reader's browser.
 * The other three have no honest destination and are left out rather than
 * wired to nothing:
 *   - "Set HoudiniMD as F1 help" — the app has no command or settings screen
 *     that sets itself as Houdini's help target; `help.rs` only reads help
 *     pages out of an install, it does not register one.
 *   - "Keyboard shortcuts" — the mirrored docs page with this title
 *     (`basics/hotkeys`, "Configuring hotkeys") teaches Houdini's own hotkey
 *     editor, not this app's shortcuts, so it would answer a different
 *     question than the row asks. The app states its own shortcuts in the
 *     status bar, not on a page of its own.
 *   - "How to pin pages" — the act is a feature of this app (`toggleBookmark`
 *     in `lib/store/library.ts`, called "Bookmark" everywhere else in the
 *     UI), not a topic the mirrored SideFX docs cover, and the app has no
 *     help screen of its own to send the row to.

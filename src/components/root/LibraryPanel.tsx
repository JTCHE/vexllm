/**
 * What the reader did last, under the search field.
 *
 * Two lists behind two tabs, because they answer the same question — "take me
 * back to a page I already know" — and only one of them is ever the answer.
 * Recents is the tab that opens, because it is true on the first session and
 * bookmarks are not.
 *
 * Every row carries its own bookmark flag on the left. Keeping a page is a
 * one-click act from the list the reader is already looking at, which is what
 * makes the Bookmarks tab fill up at all — a bookmark buried in a page menu
 * gets used by nobody.
 *
 * The list fades out at the bottom rather than ending on a cut row: the panel
 * is as tall as the window leaves it, so where it ends is an accident of the
 * window size and should not read as the end of the list.
 *
 * A cold window — no recents and no bookmarks — has no trail to show, so it
 * shows `ExploreColumns` instead of an empty pair of tabs.

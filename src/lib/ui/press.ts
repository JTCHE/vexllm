/**
 * EVERY CONTROL IN THE WINDOW ACTS ON THE PRESS, NOT ON THE RELEASE.
 *
 * A browser raises `click` only after the button comes back up, so a control
 * wired to `onClick` waits out the whole time a finger rests on it — about a
 * tenth of a second, every time. That wait is the difference between a panel
 * that answers and a panel that lags, and it is the only thing separating this
 * app from the website it replaces.
 *
 * The rule is ONE listener on the document, not a prop each control has to
 * remember. A control opts in by being a control: a link, a button, or
 * anything wearing `role="button"`. Nothing has to be wired up, and a control
 * written next year is fast the day it is written.
 *
 * How it works: the press finds the control under the pointer and clicks it
 * there and then. The browser still raises its own click when the button comes
 * back up, and that one is swallowed — so every handler runs exactly once, and
 * every handler is still a plain `onClick`.

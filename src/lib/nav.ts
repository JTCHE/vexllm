/**
 * Where the reader is in their own trail, so the title bar can say whether
 * back and forward lead anywhere.
 *
 * The router moves through the same `window.history` the browser does, and
 * that object tells you nothing: `history.length` counts the whole tab and
 * never shrinks, and there is no "can I go forward" to ask. What it DOES carry
 * is the index the router stamps on every entry it pushes (`history.state.idx`).
 * From the index and the kind of the last move, both answers follow:
 *
 *   - back leads somewhere when the index is past the first entry;
 *   - forward leads somewhere when the index is short of the last one, and the
 *     last one is only known because a PUSH truncates whatever was ahead of it.
 *
 * So the trail's length is tracked here, reset by every push.

/**
 * What the reader has read, and what they kept.
 *
 * Both lists hold the same thing — a page, by the little the UI needs to draw
 * a row for it — so they are one module and one shape. Recents are written by
 * the reading view on every page it opens; bookmarks are written only when the
 * reader asks.
 *
 * The store lives in `user.db`, behind `backend.ts`, so the desktop window
 * and Houdini's help pane — two different origins — read and write the same
 * rows. See spec: Local — User config shared between the window and the help
 * pane.
 *
 * A write updates the in-memory copy at once, so the surface that made it
 * never waits on a round trip. The OTHER surface only learns of it on its own
 * next poll, which runs on window focus: the reader notices a change made
 * elsewhere on the way back to the window that shows it, never mid-glance.

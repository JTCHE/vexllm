/**
 * THE MACHINE THE APP ACTUALLY RUNS ON: ONE THAT IS ALREADY BUSY.
 *
 * The whole point of this product is that it stays fast while Houdini cooks.
 * So every number the harness takes on a quiet machine is half an answer, and
 * this file supplies the other half: a real Houdini cook, running the whole
 * time the measurements are repeated.
 *
 * It is `hython` and not the Houdini MCP server, which has not connected on
 * this machine since 27 Aug 2026 — see the spec. `hython` needs no window and
 * no plugin, and it cooks with the same engine an artist's session does.
 *
 * A machine with no free licence, or no Houdini at all, gets the second load:
 * one thread per core burning arithmetic, plus a block of memory. That is a
 * weaker test — no disk pressure and no Houdini scheduler — so the report says
 * which of the two ran.

 *
 * The back-end numbers are `src-tauri/src/bin/probe/main.rs`. This file
 * answers the ones that only exist once a person is typing at the app: the
 * delay between a key press and the row that answers it, the time a page takes
 * to open and draw, and what happens when navigation is hammered.
 *
 * It drives the BUILT bundle — `dist/`, the same files the installer ships —
 * served by `probe --serve`, which answers `invoke` with the same Rust
 * functions the Tauri commands call. The webview is Chromium here and WebView2
 * in the shipped app; both are Chromium, and the numbers below are React and
 * layout work, not engine trivia. What this cannot see is Tauri's own IPC,
 * which is why `ipc.round_trip` is reported beside them: it is the part of
 * every number here that the real app pays differently.
 *
 * Every measurement is taken INSIDE the page, between two `performance.now()`
 * stamps, so no part of it is the driver talking to the browser.
